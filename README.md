# Action-Network

is [She's the First](https://shesthefist.org) newest platform to promote activism in local communities. Each month, you’ll be invited to tackle a different issue affecting women and girls’ lives ―and you can do it right on your phone, no matter where you are.
Get ready for:
well-vetted content (articles, podcasts, and videos) how-to guides from young and experienced activists about how they’ve made a difference―and how you can too points you can earn for reading and taking action (accountability is everything!)
This month, we're focusing in on intersectional feminism. Sign up with your email and mobile number - we promise never to share them - and let's get started on creating a more equitable world for women and girls.
