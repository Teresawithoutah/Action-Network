						We’re guessing that if you’re reading this, you already identify as a feminist -- but we want to take a minute to talk about why we should be talking about intersectional feminism more often.
						Here’s the general idea: intersectional feminism breaks through the barriers created by all identities, not just gender identity.
						And that’s important, because the fact of the matter is that feminism minus intersectionality isn’t really feminism at all.
		      </p>
		      <p class="paragraph2">
						Let’s break it down.
		      </p>
					<p class="paragraph2">
						Entire textbooks are devoted to the definition of feminism, but it can be summed up in five simple words: Women and men are equal.
						 We tend to hear stereotypes, but the truth is that feminists come in all shapes and sizes.
						 This definition is becoming more and more common; even Miss USA agrees (and eloquently so).

					 But now, let’s take this a step further. When we talk about women, which women are we talking about?
				 </p>

				 <p>
					 The fight for equality has happened in different ways. In China, the feminist movement started during the Chinese Revolution and has always been deeply concerned
					 with class issues; in India, women have been holding talking circles to address social issues for generations.
					 In Western nations, the suffragette movement is referred to as the first political campaign that fought for equal rights for women.
					 But unlike the emerging feminism seen in other countries, Western women focused their efforts on the rights of white middle-class women.
					 Black women, poor women, disabled women, and other identities were not included in this movement - and were often intentionally omitted.

					 Now fast forward 70 years. The understanding that systems of oppression work together has been understood for a long time,
					 but the phrase ‘intersectional feminism’ was coined in 1989 by Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw.
				 </p>
				 <p>
					 It's important to look boldly at the reality of race and gender bias. She says that “if you're standing in the path of multiple forms of exclusion,
					 you're likely to get hit by both.” Want more of her wisdom?

						When we put this together, we find that intersectional feminism is just a way of saying “be inclusive.”
						Regardless of gender, race, or ability, people should be treated with respect.
						So instead of saying men and women are equal, it creates a new motto: people are equal.

					Maybe you find yourself thinking, "I’m a nice person. Why do I need to be intersectional?"
					The answer is that nobody is perfect, and we’re fighting against systems that have existed for hundreds of year.
					Being a nice person doesn’t exclude us from doing and saying things that prop up oppressive structures, even accidentally.

						This is where privilege comes into play. A helpful way to think about privilege is to examine how your identity has not held you back.
						For instance, if you’re white, then your race has never prevented you from getting paid a fair wage.
						If you speak the dominant language in your country, your native tongue hasn’t prevented you from landing a job offer.
						Having privilege doesn’t mean you’ve actively held another person back; it means that your identity didn’t make it harder for you to succeed in life.

		      What is the dominant narrative? Mankind (errr...womankind) has a long history that has been written only by certain humans. Consider who determines the words we use and how they can set what’s considered ‘normal’. For example, do you know what it really means when you call someone hysterical? Hysterical comes from the greek word for womb, hystera. Ancient Greeks believed in the theory of a “wandering womb” and that the best cure was for women to always be pregnant. This later turned into a “hysteria” diagnosis, which acted as a “catch-all” syndrome for mental illness among women. This was not removed from modern medical diagnosis until 1980.

								You might also be thinking, what does this have to do with education? The answer is: a lot.
								First, we need to start with a quick history lesson on colonialism.
								The simplest description is when one culture conquests another for economic or societal gain, and typically includes racial differences.

								Time to crack open the history book.
								Raden Adjeng Kartini was an Indonesian woman who fought for her country’s independence from Dutch colonialism.
								She fought for independence from the Dutch and believed that education was the best solution for women in her country to be free from colonial rule.
								Her thought leadership helped set the tone for education as a pathway out of oppression.

							Looking for how this all connects? Let’s look at an example of how we can view education with feminism versus intersectional feminism.
						</p>
						<p>
							Feminism would see education as an issue in India, because it is the country with the highest rate of child marriage, with 10,063,000 girls married before the age of 15 and <a href="http://www.pgaction.org/pdf/2016-GNB_The_Role_of_Parliamentarians_Toolkit.pdf"> an estimated 26 million </a> (26,610,000)  married by the age of 18.  An intersectional feminist view would also note that in <a href="https://www.unicef.org/media/files/Child_Marriage_Report_7_17_LR..pdf"> India</a>, the median age at first marriage is 19.7 years for women in the richest fifth compared to 15.4 for the poorest women. So being a poor women in India means that you have an increased chance of being forced to marry without consent - and addressing these issues means focusing educational solutions on the those living in poverty.
